# Predicting and Simulating Asylum Seeker Flow to Improve the Operations Efficiency of the US Department of Homeland Security
Sarah Luthra // TJHSST Computer Systems Research Lab 2019 - 2020

## Project Overview
An inability to accurately predict the refugee arrival rate from countries such as El Salvador at the border causes uncoordinated staffing of officials at the land ports, resulting in long queues and wait times throughout this multi-step process. To address this issue, my project predicts the number of asylum seekers and simulates the impacts on government staffing and resource allocation. 

## Resources
This project requires Python 3+ and R.
